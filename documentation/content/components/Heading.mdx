import Heading from '@react/react-spectrum/Heading';


## Overview

**Headings** in Spectrum are available in several variations for different uses and multiple levels of loudness for various attention-getting needs just as a normal `heading` element in React. The `variant` property defines the heading analogous to the normal heading element in react. Eg. `variant="pageTitle"` refers to `<h2>` tag of HTML.

## Example

<Heading>React</Heading>

```jsx
<Heading>React</Heading>
```

## Variants

Headings in Spectrum are available in 5 variants, each having a different size and style. The "display" variant (default) should be used for main headings, followed by "pageTitle" variant headings, then the less important "subtitle1" variant headings. Three "subtitle" variants exist: "subtitle1", "subtitle2" and "subtitle3".

<Heading>React</Heading>
<Heading variant="pageTitle">React</Heading>
<Heading variant="subtitle1">React</Heading>
<Heading variant="subtitle2">React</Heading>
<Heading variant="subtitle3">React</Heading>

```jsx
<Heading>React</Heading>
<Heading variant="pageTitle">React</Heading>
<Heading variant="subtitle1">React</Heading>
<Heading variant="subtitle2">React</Heading>
<Heading variant="subtitle3">React</Heading>
```

## Internationalization

To internationalize a heading, a localized string should be passed as a child.

## Accessibility

Each Heading variant is rendered using a corresponding HTML `<h1>`–`<h4>` element.
The default "display" variant renders with `<h1>`, both "pageTitle" and "subtitle1" variants render with `<h2>`, the "subtitle2" variant renders with `<h3>`, and "subtitle3" renders with `<h4>`.

### Using `aria-level`

Depending on context, it may sometimes be necessary to override the default heading level to match the hierarchy of headings within the web page using the `aria-level` prop.

<Heading variant="subtitle2" aria-level={4}>Heading at {<code>aria-level</code>} 4</Heading>

```jsx
<Heading variant="subtitle2" aria-level={4}>Heading at {<code>aria-level</code>} 4</Heading>
```

### `id` prop

If the the Heading is associated with a navigation or collection component, add an `id` attribute and use `aria-labelledby` to assign the Heading as a label for the control.

For example, here a SideNav component is labelled using a Heading as the navigation for "Spectrum Components":

```jsx
<Heading variant="subtitle2" id="sidenav-header-id">Spectrum Components</Heading>
<SideNav aria-labelledby="sidenav-header-id">
  …
</SideNav>
```
